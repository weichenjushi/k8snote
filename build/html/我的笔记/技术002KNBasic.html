<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Protocol:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A protocol is the set of rules or algorithms which define the way how
two entities can communicate across the network and there exists
different protocol defined at each layer of the OSI model. Few of such
protocols are TCP, IP, UDP, ARP, DHCP, FTP and so on.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>MAC Address (Media Access Control address):</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also known as physical address, is the unique identifier of each host
and is associated with the NIC (Network Interface Card).</p>
<p>MAC address is assigned to the NIC at the time of manufacturing. Length
of the MAC address is : 12-nibble/ 6 bytes/ 48 bits</p>
<p>Type “ipconfig/all” in the command prompt and press ‘Enter’, this gives
us the MAC address.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Port:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Port can be referred as a logical channel through which data can be
sent/received to an application. Any host may have multiple applications
running, and each of this application is identified using the port
number on which they are running.</p>
<p>Port number is a 16-bit integer, hence we have 216 ports available which
are categorized as shown below:</p>
<p>PORT TYPES RANGE Well known Ports 0 – 1023 Registered Ports 1024 – 49151
Ephemeral Ports 49152 – 65535 Number of ports: 65,536 Range: 0 – 65535</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ARP:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol.</p>
<p>It is used to convert the IP address to its corresponding Physical
Address(i.e.MAC Address).</p>
<p>ARP is used by the Data Link Layer to identify the MAC address of the
Receiver’s machine.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Internet:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This model divides methods into a layered system of protocols. These
layers are as follows:</p>
<p>Application layer (highest) – concerned with the data(URL, type, etc),
where HTTP, HTTPS, etc comes in.</p>
<p>Transport layer – responsible for end-to-end communication over a
network. Network layer – provides data route. Client和server之间的交互图

<h3>Transmission Modes in Computer Networks (Simplex, Half-Duplex and Full-Duplex)<a class="headerlink" href="#transmission-modes-in-computer-networks-simplex-half-duplex-and-full-duplex" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h3>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/e462d5e369154ac0762780a975eb64b9.png" /></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Simplex Mode</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In Simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way
street. Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other
can only receive. The simplex mode can use the entire capacity of the
channel to send data in one direction.</p>
<p>Example: Keyboard and traditional monitors. The keyboard can only
introduce input, the monitor can only give the output.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../_images/03f5f1ec47b0f60732221e561d4235f6.png" /></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Half-Duplex Mode</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not
at the same time. When one device is sending, the other can only
receive, and vice versa. The half-duplex mode is used in cases where
there is no need for communication in both direction at the same time.
The entire capacity of the channel can be utilized for each direction.</p>
<p>Example: Walkie- talkie in which message is sent one at a time and
messages are sent in both the directions.</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../_images/bb6d23c0bba8932c5c59798d4d40d9d9.png" /></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Full-Duplex Mode</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In full-duplex mode, both stations can transmit and receive
simultaneously. In full_duplex mode, signals going in one direction
share the capacity of the link with signals going in other direction,
this sharing can occur in two ways:</p>
<p>Either the link must contain two physically separate transmission paths,
one for sending and other for receiving.</p>
<p>Or the capacity is divided between signals travelling in both
directions.</p>
<p>Full-duplex mode is used when communication in both direction is
required all the time. The capacity of the channel, however must be
divided between the two directions.</p>
<p>Example: Telephone Network in which there is communication between two
persons by a telephone line, through which both can talk and listen at
the same time.</p>

<p>Figure 1 : Every device is connected with another via dedicated
channels. These channels are known as links.</p>
<p>If suppose, N number of devices are connected with each other in mesh
topology, then total number of ports that is required by each device is
​ N-1. In the Figure 1, there are 5 devices connected to each other,
hence total number of ports required is 4.</p>
<p>If suppose, N number of devices are connected with each other in mesh
topology, then total number of dedicated links required to connect them
is NC2 i.e. N(N-1)/2. In the Figure 1, there are 5 devices connected to
each other, hence total number of links required is 5*4/2 = 10.</p>
<p>Advantages of this topology : It is robust.</p>
<p>Fault is diagnosed easily. Data is reliable because data is transferred
among the devices through dedicated channels or links.</p>
<p>Provides security and privacy. Problems with this topology :
Installation and configuration is difficult.</p>
<p>Cost of cables are high as bulk wiring is required, hence suitable for
less number of devices.</p>
<p>Cost of maintenance is high.</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 2 : A star topology having four systems connected to single point
of connection i.e. hub.</p>
<p>Advantages of this topology :</p>
<p>If N devices are connected to each other in star topology, then the
number of cables required to connect them is N. So, it is easy to set
up.</p>
<p>Each device require only 1 port i.e. to connect to the hub. Problems
with this topology :</p>
<p>If the concentrator (hub) on which the whole topology relies fails, the
whole system will crash down.</p>
<p>Cost of installation is high. Performance is based on the single
concentrator i.e. hub.</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><p>Bus Topology</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network
device is connected to single cable. It transmits the data from one end
to another in single direction. No bi-directional feature is in bus
topology.</p>
<p><img alt="image6" src="../_images/86f576e52871a11df13b796289e37e7a.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 3 : A bus topology with shared backbone cable. The nodes are
connected to the channel via drop lines.</p>
<p>Advantages of this topology :</p>
<p>If N devices are connected to each other in bus topology, then the
number of cables required to connect them is 1 ​which is known as
backbone cable and N drop lines are required.</p>
<p>Cost of the cable is less as compared to other topology, but it is used
to built small networks.</p>
<p>Problems with this topology : If the common cable fails, then the whole
system will crash down.</p>
<p>If the network traffic is heavy, it increases collisions in the network.
To avoid this, various protocols are used in MAC layer known as Pure
Aloha, Slotted Aloha, CSMA/CD etc.</p>
<ul class="simple">

<p>In this topology, it forms a ring connecting a devices with its exactly
two neighbouring devices</p>

<p>Figure 4 : A ring topology comprises of 4 stations connected with each
forming a ring..</p>
<p>The following operations takes place in ring topology are :</p>
<p>One station is known as monitor station which takes all the
responsibility to perform the operations.</p>
<p>To transmit the data, station has to hold the token. After the
transmission is done, the token is to be released for other stations to
use.</p>
<p>When no station is transmitting the data, then the token will circulate
in the ring.</p>
<p>There are two types of token release techniques : Early token release
releases the token just after the transmitting the data and Delay token
release releases the token after the acknowledgement is received from
the receiver.</p>
<p>Advantages of this topology : The possibility of collision is minimum in
this type of topology. Cheap to install and expand. Problems with this
topology : Troubleshooting is difficult in this topology.</p>
<p>Addition of stations in between or removal of stations can disturb the
whole topology.</p>

<p>This topology is a collection of two or more topologies which are
described above. This is a scalable topology which can be expanded
easily. It is reliable one but at the same it is a costly topology.</p>

<li><p>Data Link Layer (DLL) (Layer 2)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When a packet arrives in a network, it is the responsibility of DLL to
transmit it to the Host using its MAC address.</p>
<p>Data Link Layer is divided into two sub layers : 1.Logical Link Control
(LLC)2.Media Access Control (MAC) The functions of the data Link layer
are :</p>
<p>Framing: Framing is a function of the data link layer. It provides a way
for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the
receiver. This can be accomplished by attaching special bit patterns to
the beginning and end of the frame.</p>
<p>Physical addressing: After creating frames, Data link layer adds
physical addresses (MAC address) of sender and/or receiver in the header
of each frame.</p>
<p>Error control: Data link layer provides the mechanism of error control
in which it detects and retransmits damaged or lost frames.</p>
<p>Flow Control: The data rate must be constant on both sides else the data
may get corrupted thus , flow control coordinates that amount of data
that can be sent before receiving acknowledgement.</p>
<p>Access control: When a single communication channel is shared by
multiple devices, MAC sub-layer of data link layer helps to determine
which device has control over the channel at a given time.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Packet in Data Link layer is referred as Frame.</p></li>

routing i.e. selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet, from
the number of routes available. The sender &amp; receiver’s IP address are
placed in the header by network layer.The functions of the Network layer
are :</p>
<p>Routing: The network layer protocols determine which route is suitable
from source to destination. This function of network layer is known as
routing.Logical Addressing: In order to identify each device on
internetwork uniquely, network layer defines an addressing scheme. The
sender &amp; receiver’s IP address are placed in the header by network
layer. Such an address distinguishes each device uniquely and
universally.* Segment in Network layer is referred as Packet.</p>
<p>** Network layer is implemented by networking devices such as routers.

<p>Transport layer provides services to application layer and takes
services from network layer. The data in the transport layer is referred
to as Segments. It is responsible for the End to End delivery of the
complete message. Transport layer also provides the acknowledgment of
the successful data transmission and re-transmits the data if an error
is found.</p>

<h3>Framing in Data Link Layer<a class="headerlink" href="#framing-in-data-link-layer" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h3>
<p>Frames are the units of digital transmission particularly in computer
networks and telecommunications. Frames are comparable to the packets of
energy called photons in case of light energy. Frame is continuously
used in Time Division Multiplexing process.</p>
<p>Framing is a point-to-point connection between two computers or devices
consists of a wire in which data is transmitted as a stream of bits.
However, these bits must be framed into discernible blocks of
information. Framing is a function of the data link layer. It provides a
way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the
receiver. Ethernet, token ring, frame relay, and other data link layer
technologies have their own frame structures. Frames have headers that
contain information such as error-checking codes.</p>

<p>Each frame consists of the sender’s address and a destination address.
The destination address defines where the packet is to go and the
sender’s address helps the recipient acknowledge the receipt.</p>
<p>Frames could be of fixed size or variable size. In fixed-size framing,
there is no need for defining the boundaries of the frames as the size
itself can be used to define the end of the frame and the beginning of
the next frame. But, in variable-size framing, we need a way to define

<h3>Packet Switching and Delays in Computer Network<a class="headerlink" href="#packet-switching-and-delays-in-computer-network" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h3>
<p>Packet switching is a method of transferring the data to a network in
form of packets. In order to transfer the file fast and efficient manner
over the network and minimize the transmission latency, the data is
broken into small pieces of variable length, called Packet.</p>
<p>Packet Switching uses Store and Forward technique while switching the
packets</p>

<p>网络层位于OSI第三层，用于跨网络之间传输数据包，被认为是OSI
Model的基石。This layer contains hardware devices such as routers,
bridges, firewalls, and switches, but it actually creates a logical
image of the most efficient communication route and implements it with a
physical medium. Network layer protocols exist in every host or router.
The router examines the header fields of all the IP packets that pass
through it. Internet Protocol and Netware IPX/SPX are the most common
protocols associated with the network layer.</p>
<p>In the OSI model, the network layer responds to requests from the layer
above it (transport layer) and issues requests to the layer below it
(data link layer).</p>
<p>Responsibilities of Network Layer:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Packet forwarding/Routing of packets: Relaying of data packets from
one network segment to another by nodes in a computer network</p></li>
<li><p>Connectionless communication(IP): A data transmission method used in
packet-switched networks in which each data unit is separately
addressed and routed based on information carried by it</p></li>
<li><p>Fragmentation of data packets: Splitting of data packets that are too
large to be transmitted on the network</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IPv4:</strong></p>
<p>IPv4 isIPv4: a connectionless protocol used for packet switched
networks. It operates on a best effort delivery model, in which neither
delivery is guaranteed, nor proper sequencing or avoidance of duplicate
delivery is assured. Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth
revision of the Internet Protocol and a widely used protocol in data
communication over different kinds of networks. IPv4 is a connectionless
protocol used in packet-switched layer networks, such as Ethernet. It
provides a logical connection between network devices by providing
identification for each device. There are many ways to configure IPv4
with all kinds of devices – including manual and automatic
configurations – depending on the network type.</p>
<p>IPv4 is defined and specified in IETF publication RFC 791.</p>
<p>IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses for Ethernet communication in five classes:
A, B, C, D and E. Classes A, B and C have a different bit length for
addressing the network host. Class D addresses are reserved for military
purposes, while class E addresses are reserved for future use.</p>
<p>IPv4 uses 32-bit (4 byte) addressing, which gives 232 addresses. IPv4
addresses are written in the dot-decimal notation, which comprises of
four octets of the address expressed individually in decimal and
separated by periods, for instance, 192.168.1.5.</p>
<p>IPv4 Datagram Header Size of the header is 20 to 60 bytes. <img alt="image16" src="../_images/beb0fb4d024752e1e6a89d4027ff6eb3.png" /></p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>VERSION: Version of the IP protocol (4 bits), which is 4 for IPv4

HLEN: IP header length (4 bits), which is the number of 32 bit

Type of service: Low Delay, High Throughput, Reliability (8 bits)

Total Length: Length of header + Data (16 bits), which has a
minimum value 20 bytes and the maximum is 65,535 bytes

<h3>Introduction of Classful IP Addressing<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-of-classful-ip-addressing" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h3>
<p>Classful Addressing The 32 bit IP address is divided into five
sub-classes. These are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Class A</p></li>
<li><p>Class B</p></li>
<li><p>Class C</p></li>
<li><p>Class D</p></li>
<li><p>Class E</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these classes has a valid range of IP addresses. Classes D and E
are reserved for multicast and experimental purposes respectively. The
order of bits in the first octet determine the classes of IP address.</p>
<p>IPv4 address is divided into two parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Network ID</p></li>
<li><p>Host ID</p></li>
</ul>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Class A:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>IP address belonging to class A are assigned to the networks that
contain a large number of hosts.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The network ID is 8 bits long.</p></li>
<li><p>The host ID is 24 bits long.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The higher order bit of the first octet in class A is always set to 0.
The remaining 7 bits in first octet are used to determine network ID.
The 24 bits of host ID are used to determine the host in any network.
The default subnet mask for class A is 255.x.x.x. Therefore, class A has
a total of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>2^7-2= 126 network ID(Here 2 address is subracted because 0.0.0.0 and

<li><p>The host ID is 8 bits long.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The higher order bits of the first octet of IP addresses of class C are
always set to 110. The remaining 21 bits are used to determine network
ID. The 8 bits of host ID is used to determine the host in any network.

<p>IP address belonging to class D are reserved for multi-casting. The
higher order bits of the first octet of IP addresses belonging to class
D are always set to 1110. The remaining bits are for the address that
interested hosts recognize.</p>

<li><p>Within any network, the host ID must be unique to that network.</p></li>
<li><p>Host ID in which all bits are set to 0 cannot be assigned because
this host ID is used to represent the network ID of the IP address.</p></li>
<li><p>Host ID in which all bits are set to 1 cannot be assigned because
this host ID is reserved as a broadcast address to send packets to
all the hosts present on that particular network.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Rules for assigning Network ID:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hosts that are located on the same physical network are identified by
the network ID, as all host on the same physical network is assigned the
same network ID. The network ID is assigned based on the following
rules:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The network ID cannot start with 127 because 127 belongs to class A
address and is reserved for internal loop-back functions.</p></li>
<li><p>All bits of network ID set to 1 are reserved for use as an IP
broadcast address and therefore, cannot be used.</p></li>
<li><p>All bits of network ID set to 0 are used to denote a specific host on
the local network and are not routed and therefore, aren’t used.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Problems with Classful Addressing:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with this classful addressing method is that millions of
class A address are wasted, many of the class B address are wasted,
whereas, number of addresses available in class C is so small that it
cannot cater the needs of organizations. Class D addresses are used for
multicast routing and are therefore available as a single block only.
Class E addresses are reserved.</p>
<p>Since there are these problems, Classful networking was replaced by
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) in 1993. We will be discussing
Classless addressing in next post.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Classless Addressing</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To reduce the wastage of IP addresses in a block, we use sub-netting.
What we do is that we use host id bits as net id bits of a classful IP
address. We give the IP address and define the number of bits for mask
along with it (usually followed by a ‘/’ symbol), like, 192.168.1.1/28.
Here, subnet mask is found by putting the given number of bits out of 32
as 1, like, in the given address, we need to put 28 out of 32 bits as 1
and the rest as 0, and so, the subnet mask would be 255.255.255.240.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Some values calculated in subnetting :</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Number of subnets : Given bits for mask – No. of bits in default mask</p></li>
<li><p>Subnet address : AND result of subnet mask and the given IP address</p></li>
<li><p>Broadcast address : By putting the host bits as 1 and retaining the
network bits as in the IP address</p></li>
<li><p>Number of hosts per subnet : 2(32 – Given bits for mask) – 2</p></li>
